# Railway Build Optimization
# This file tells Railway to use PyTorch CPU-only builds (smaller & faster)

# Option 1: Create a railway.toml file (recommended)
# This will use CPU-only PyTorch builds which are much smaller

[build]
command = "pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch==2.8.0 torchvision==0.23.0 torchaudio==2.8.0 && pip install -r requirements.txt"

# Option 2: Or modify your Procfile to use a build script
# Create a build.sh script instead
